# JWE

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwe/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwe/actions/workflows/test.yml)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jwe.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jwe)

A ruby implementation of the [RFC 7516 JSON Web Encryption (JWE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516) standard.

## Installing

```bash
gem install jwe
```
## Usage

This example uses the default alg and enc methods (RSA-OAEP and A128CBC-HS256). It requires an RSA key.

```ruby
require 'jwe'

key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.generate(2048)
payload = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

encrypted = JWE.encrypt(payload, key)
puts encrypted

plaintext = JWE.decrypt(encrypted, key)
puts plaintext #"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
```

This example uses a custom enc method:

```ruby
require 'jwe'

key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.generate(2048)
payload = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

encrypted = JWE.encrypt(payload, key, enc: 'A192GCM')
puts encrypted

plaintext = JWE.decrypt(encrypted, key)
puts plaintext #"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
```

This example uses the 'dir' alg method. It requires an encryption key of the correct size for the enc method

```ruby
require 'jwe'

key = SecureRandom.random_bytes(32)
payload = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

encrypted = JWE.encrypt(payload, key, alg: 'dir')
puts encrypted

plaintext = JWE.decrypt(encrypted, key)
puts plaintext #"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
```

This example uses the DEFLATE algorithm on the plaintext to reduce the result size.

```ruby
require 'jwe'

key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.generate(2048)
payload = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

encrypted = JWE.encrypt(payload, key, zip: 'DEF')
puts encrypted

plaintext = JWE.decrypt(encrypted, key)
puts plaintext #"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
```

This example sets an extra **plaintext** custom header.

```ruby
require 'jwe'

key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.generate(2048)
payload = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

# In this case we add a copyright line to the headers (it can be anything you like
# just remember it is plaintext).
encrypted = JWE.encrypt(payload, key, copyright: 'This is my stuff! All rights reserved')
puts encrypted
```

## Available Algorithms

The RFC 7518 JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) spec defines the algorithms for [encryption](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-5.1)
 and [key management](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-4.1) to be supported by a JWE implementation.

Only a subset of these algorithms is implemented in this gem. Striked elements are not available:

Key management:
* RSA1_5
* RSA-OAEP (default)
* ~~RSA-OAEP-256~~
* A128KW
* A192KW
* A256KW
* dir
* ~~ECDH-ES~~
* ~~ECDH-ES+A128KW~~
* ~~ECDH-ES+A192KW~~
* ~~ECDH-ES+A256KW~~
* ~~A128GCMKW~~
* ~~A192GCMKW~~
* ~~A256GCMKW~~
* ~~PBES2-HS256+A128KW~~
* ~~PBES2-HS384+A192KW~~
* ~~PBES2-HS512+A256KW~~

Encryption:
* A128CBC-HS256 (default)
* A192CBC-HS384
* A256CBC-HS512
* A128GCM
* A192GCM
* A256GCM
